Files:

main.py		- main file of the project, accomplished problems 4, 5, and 6 and outputs to text file   
pointer.py  	- contains code for pointer pivot calibration
preprocess.py	- contains code to preprocess input data
registration.py	- contains code to perform point cloud registration
distortion.py   - contains code to undistort EM data


Folders:

data		- input data 
outputs		- folder contains the outputs for each run of main
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this project, you must type:

python main.py <name>

where name is the name of the dataset. For example:

python main.py pa1-debug-a

will create a file in the outputs directory called:

pa1-debug-a-output-2.txt



Similarly:

python main.py pa1-unknown-h

will create a file in the outputs directory called:

pa1-unknown-h-output-1.txt
